    <h1>Ibby Sasso</h1>
      <div class="about">
        Ibby started her career in public relations over 15 years ago. Her broad
        experience spans various sectors, from non-profits like Creative Growth
        Art Center to in-house roles at global consumer retail brands such as
        Gap and Levi's, along with household CPG brand Method. Additionally,
        Ibby has top-tier agency experience at KCD, where she managed accounts,
        including the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America), and
        oversaw the stateside launch of the UK brand Top Shop. Ibby also spent
        time in the Public Affairs sector, managing appearances made by Kenneth
        Cole on behalf of his social activism and cause-related work in
        partnership with amfAR (the American Foundation for AIDS Research). Ibby
        takes a strategic and targeted approach to building a tailored
        communications strategy for each client, which includes media relations,
        partnerships, brand launches, influencer relations, email marketing, and
        reputation strategy.
